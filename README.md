# Pong-Game
<p>
My attempt at the old, classic Pong game. This project makes heavy use of the SFML Graphics Library, C++, and CMake to run, configure, and compile the executable.
<br>
I've relied heavily on Software Design principles such as Strategy, Factory, Singleton, etc. to ensure modularity and simplicity to the project's design. I also incorporated the PImpl (Pointer to Implementation) Idiom for C++ which provides better hiding of private functionalities.
